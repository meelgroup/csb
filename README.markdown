# CSB

CSB (Count and Sample on Bitvectors) is an approximate model counting and almost-uniform sampling tool aimed at solving constraints of bitvectors.

To learn more about CSB, please have a look at our [SMT Workshop '24 paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3725/short2.pdf).

CSB uses [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) as its frontend and is built on top of that. For counting it uses [ApproxMC](https://github.com/meelgroup/approxmc) (with [Arjun](https://github.com/meelgroup/arjun)). For sampling, it uses [UniGen](https://github.com/meelgroup/unigen/).

## Build and install

For a quick install:

```
sudo apt install git cmake bison flex libboost-all-dev python3 perl build-essential python3-distutils-extra wget
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-serialization-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
git clone https://github.com/meelgroup/csb
cd csb
./scripts/deps/setup-csb.sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```


## Input format

The [SMT-LIB2](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml) format is the recommended file format, because it is parsed by all modern bitvector solvers. Only quantifier-free bitvectors and arrays are implemented from the SMT-LIB2 format.

### Usage as Uniform-like Sampler:
The samples should be uniform in practice. Run with an SMT-LIB2 file:

```
./csb -s --ns 10 --seed 6 myproblem.smt2
```


### Usage as Almost-uniform Sampler:

The samples are generated with theoretical guarantees on uniformity. But this procedure might be slower than uniform-like sampler.
```
./csb -u --ns 10 --seed 6 myproblem.smt2
```

Change seed value to get different samples. Refer to [this post](https://www.msoos.org/2022/06/checking-uniform-like-samplers/) to know more about uniform, almost-uniform and uniform like samplers.

### Usage as Approximate Counter:

Run with an SMT-LIB2 file:
```
./csb -c myproblem.smt2
```

## Architecture

**CSB** converts bitvector constraints into SAT using [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp), integrating with [ApproxMC](https://github.com/meelgroup/approxmc) or [UniGen](https://github.com/meelgroup/unigen/) based on specific needs of counting or sampling. The benchmarks used for evaluating CSB in the SMT workshop paper are available [here](https://utoronto-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/arijit_shaw_mail_utoronto_ca/EWcTcfGobH5Jl5SwjzRu6TQB169vWwTnjg-IXWiHJwmuDA?e=MFuxUM).
