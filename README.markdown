# CSB

CSB (Count and Sample on Bitvectors) is an approximate model counting and almost-uniform sampling tool aimed at solving constraints of bitvectors.

CSB uses [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) as its frontend and is built on top of that. For counting it uses [ApproxMC](https://github.com/meelgroup/approxmc) (with [Arjun](https://github.com/meelgroup/arjun)). For sampling, it uses [UniSamp](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/Papers/lics22.pdf).

## Build and install

For a quick install:

```
sudo apt install git cmake bison flex libboost-all-dev python3 perl build-essential python3-distutils-extra
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-serialization-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
git clone https://github.com/meelgroup/csb
cd csb
git submodule init && git submodule update
./scripts/deps/setup-gtest.sh
./scripts/deps/setup-outputcheck.sh
./scripts/deps/setup-cms.sh
./scripts/deps/setup-minisat.sh
./scripts/deps/setup-unisamp.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```


## Input format

The [SMT-LIB2](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml) format is the recommended file format, because it is parsed by all modern bitvector solvers. Only quantifier-free bitvectors and arrays are implemented from the SMT-LIB2 format.

### Usage as Uniform-like Sampler:
The samples should be uniform in practice. Run with an SMT-LIB2 file:

```
./stp -s --ns 10 --seed 6 myproblem.smt2
```


### Usage as Almost-uniform Sampler:

The samples are generated with theoretical guarantees on uniformity. But this procedure might be slower than uniform-like sampler.
```
./stp -u --ns 10 --seed 6 myproblem.smt2
```

Change seed value to get different samples. Refer to [this post](https://www.msoos.org/2022/06/checking-uniform-like-samplers/) to know more about uniform, almost-uniform and uniform like samplers.

### Usage as Approximate Counter:

Run with an SMT-LIB2 file:
```
./stp -c myproblem.smt2
```

### Python Interface for Almost-uniform Sampler:
```
In [1]: import stp
In [2]: a = stp.Solver()
In [3]: x = a.bitvec('x')
In [4]: y = a.bitvec('y')
In [5]: a.add(x + y < 20)
In [6]: a.add(x  > 10)
In [7]: a.add(y  > 10)
In [8]: a.useUnigen()
Out[8]: True
In [9]: a.check()
Out[9]: True
In [10]: a.model()
Out[10]: {'x': 2371135469, 'y': 1923831833}
```

### Python Interface for Approximate Counter:

```
In [8]: a.useApproxMC()
Out[8]: True
In [9]: a.count()
Out[9]: 180388626432
```

## Architecture

**CSB** converts bitvector constraints into SAT using [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp), integrating with [ApproxMC](https://github.com/meelgroup/approxmc) or [UniSamp](https://github.com/arijitsh/unigen/tree/unisamp) based on specific needs of counting or sampling. This tool is developed from a study on model counters and bitblasting tools, as detailed in [this study](https://arijitsh.github.io/papers/sharpsmt.pdf).
